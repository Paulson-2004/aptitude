# üß† Work and Time

### **Q1.**

‚ÄúA‚Äù can do a work in 15 days and ‚ÄúB‚Äù in 20 days. If they work on it together for 4 days, then the fraction of 
the work that is left is: 
a) 1/4     b) 1/10     c) 7/15     d) 8/15

**Solution:**

* A‚Äôs 1-day work = 1/15
* B‚Äôs 1-day work = 1/20
* Together = 7/60 per day
* In 4 days = 4 √ó 7/60 = 7/15
* Remaining work = 1 ‚àí 7/15 = **8/15**

‚úÖ **Answer: d) 8/15**

---

### **Q2.**

.‚ÄúA‚Äù alone can do a piece of work in 6 days and ‚ÄúB‚Äù alone in 8 days. ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù undertook to do it for 
Rs.3200. With the help of ‚ÄúC‚Äù, they can complete the work in 3 days, how much is to be paid to ‚ÄúC‚Äù? 
a) Rs. 375   b) Rs. 400   c) Rs. 600   d) Rs. 800

**Solution:**

Great question, Paulson üëç Let‚Äôs break it carefully.

We know:

* A‚Äôs 1-day work = $\tfrac{1}{6}$
* B‚Äôs 1-day work = $\tfrac{1}{8}$
* Together: $\tfrac{1}{6} + \tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{7}{24}$
* A+B+C = $\tfrac{1}{3}$
* So C‚Äôs 1-day work = $\tfrac{1}{3} - \tfrac{7}{24} = \tfrac{1}{24}$

### Step 1: Put them in whole number ratios

LCM of denominators (6, 8, 24) = 24.

* A = $\tfrac{1}{6} = \tfrac{4}{24}$
* B = $\tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{3}{24}$
* C = $\tfrac{1}{24} = \tfrac{1}{24}$

So ratio of their work = **4 : 3 : 1**.

### Step 2: Convert ratio to fractions of payment

* Total ratio parts = 4+3+1 = 8
* C‚Äôs share = $\tfrac{1}{8}$ of total payment.

That‚Äôs where the **1/8** came from ‚Äî it is **C‚Äôs ratio part over total ratio parts**, not directly from C‚Äôs work fraction of the whole job.

### Step 3: Calculate payment

$\tfrac{1}{8} \times 3200 = 400$.


‚úÖ **Answer: b) ‚Çπ400**

2 hours. How long will "B" alone take to do it? 
a) 8 hours   b) 10 hours   c) 12 hours   d) 24 hours 

**Solution:**

* A = 1/4, B+C = 1/3, A+C = 1/2
* C = 1/2 ‚àí 1/4 = 1/4
* B = 1/3 ‚àí 1/4 = 1/12
* Time = 12 hours

‚úÖ **Answer: c) 12 hours**

---

### **Q4.**

."A" can do a certain work in same time in which "B" and "C" together can do it. If "A" and "B" together 
could do it in 10 days and "C" alone in 50 days, then "B" alone could do it in: 
a) 15 days   b) 20 days   c) 25 days   d) 30 days 

**Solution:**

* A+B = 1/10
* C = 1/50
* A = B+C ‚áí A = B + 1/50
* A+B = 1/10 ‚áí (B+1/50)+B = 1/10
* Solve ‚áí B = 1/25
* Time = 25 days

‚úÖ **Answer: c) 25 days**

between the capacity of men and a woman? 
a) 3 : 4   b) 4 : 3   c) 5 : 3   d) Data inadequate

**Solution:**

* Total work (women) = 20√ó16 = 320
* Total work (men) = 16√ó15 = 240
* Man : Woman = 240 : 320 = 3 : 4

‚úÖ **Answer: a) 3:4**

# üí∞ Profit and Loss

### **Q6.**

.The cost price of 20 articles is the same as the selling price of X article. If the profit is 25%, then the value of 
X is: 
a) 15   b) 16   c) 18   d) 25

**Solution:**

Let‚Äôs carefully verify step by step:

We are told:

* Cost price (CP) of **20 articles** = Selling price (SP) of **X articles**.
* Profit = 25% ‚Üí so **SP = 1.25 √ó CP**.

---

### Step 1: Assume CP of 1 article = ‚Çπ1

Then, CP of 20 articles = ‚Çπ20.

### Step 2: Selling price relation

Since profit = 25%,

$$
SP \, \text{of 1 article} = 1.25 √ó CP = 1.25 √ó 1 = ‚Çπ1.25
$$

So, SP of **X articles** = ‚Çπ1.25 √ó X.

---

### Step 3: Equating

Given: CP of 20 articles = SP of X articles

$$
20 = 1.25X
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve

$$
X = \frac{20}{1.25} = \frac{200}{12.5} = 16
$$

‚úÖ Correct Answer: **b) 16**

Rs.33. what was his percentage profit? 
a) 3.5   b) 4.5   c) 6.6   d) 5.6 

**Solution:**

* CP = 20√ó375 = 7500
* SP = 240√ó33 = 7920
* Profit = 420
* Profit% = 420/7500 √ó100 = 5.6%

‚úÖ **Answer: d) 5.6%**

---

### **Q10.**

Some articles were bought at 6 articles for Rs.5 and sold at 5 articles for Rs.6. Gain percent is: 
a) 30%   b) 33 1/3%   c) 35%   d) 44%

**Solution:**

* CP per = 5/6, SP per = 6/5
* Profit% = (SP‚àíCP)/CP √ó100 = (11/30)/(5/6)√ó100 = 44%

‚úÖ **Answer: d) 44%**

# üß† Work, Time & Speed

### Q1 ‚Äî train speed ‚Üë 20% so time reduces by 10 min. Find original time.

Let original time = $T$. If speed increases by 20%, new speed = $1.2\times$ original ‚áí time becomes $\dfrac{T}{1.2}=\dfrac{5}{6}T$.
Difference: $T - \dfrac{5}{6}T = \dfrac{T}{6} = 10$ minutes ‚áí $T = 60$ minutes.
**Answer: B) 60 min.**

---

### Q2 ‚Äî pipes: fill in 10 h, 12 h; drain in 20 h. All open together ‚Üí time to fill?

Rates (tank per hour): Pipe1 = $1/10$, Pipe2 = $1/12$, Drain = $-1/20$.
Net rate = $1/10 + 1/12 - 1/20$. Use LCM 60: $(6 + 5 - 3)/60 = 8/60 = 2/15$ tank/hour.
Time = reciprocal = $15/2 = 7.5$ hours = **7 h 30 min**.
**Note:** 7.5 h is the correct exact answer; the printed options (7, 8, 6, 9) do **not** include 7.5.
**Correct result:** 7.5 hours (7 hr 30 min).

---

### Q10 ‚Äî A = 8 days, B = 12 days. Together?

Rates: $1/8 + 1/12 = (3+2)/24 = 5/24$ job/day. Time $= 24/5 = 4.8$ days.
**Answer: A) 4.8 days.**

---

### Q11 ‚Äî train 60 km/h crosses pole in 9 s. Find length.

Convert speed to m/s: $60 \times \dfrac{1000}{3600} = \dfrac{50}{3}$ m/s.
Length $= \text{speed} \times \text{time} = \dfrac{50}{3}\times 9 = 150$ m.
**Answer: B) 150 m.**

---

### Q12 ‚Äî 10 men ‚áí 15 days. How many days for 6 men?

**Answer: A) 196 W.**

---

### Q5 ‚Äî avg of 20 students = 21; with teacher (21 people) avg = 22. Teacher‚Äôs age?

Sum of students = $20\times21 = 420$. Total with teacher = $21\times22 = 462$. Teacher‚Äôs age = $462-420 = 42$.
**Answer: B) 42 years.**

---

### Q6 ‚Äî ODD ONE OUT: 169, 196, 225, 256, 289. Which doesn‚Äôt belong?

Check representations:

* 169 = $13^2$
* 196 = $14^2$
* 225 = $15^2$
* 256 = $16^2$ and also $4^4 = 2^8$ (a perfect 4th power / pure power of 2)
* 289 = $17^2$

**Observation:** 256 is the only number that is also a perfect 4th power (and a pure power of 2). The others are simple squares of consecutive integers but *not* higher perfect powers. So 256 stands out.
**Answer: D) 256.**

(Other valid distinguishing properties exist, but the 4th-power/ power-of-2 distinction is the cleanest.)

---

### Q7 ‚Äî circular field circumference = 88 m. Area?

Circumference $=2\pi r = 88$. Using $\pi = 22/7$ we get $r = 88/(2\pi)=88/(44/7)=14$ m.
Area $=\pi r^2 = \dfrac{22}{7}\times 14^2 = \dfrac{22}{7}\times196 = 616$ m¬≤.
**Answer: A) 616 m¬≤.**

---

### Q8 ‚Äî CP of 15 articles = SP of 12 articles. Profit %?

Let CP per article = $c$, SP per article = $s$. Given $15c = 12s \Rightarrow s = \dfrac{15}{12}c = \dfrac{5}{4}c$.
Profit per article = $s-c = \dfrac{1}{4}c$. Profit% $= \dfrac{1/4c}{c}\times100 = 25\%$.
**Answer: B) 25%.**

---

### Q9 ‚Äî milk\:water = 5:1. After adding 5 L water ratio becomes 5:2. Original milk quantity?

Let milk = $5x$, water = $x$. After adding 5 L water: $5x:(x+5) = 5:2$. So $\dfrac{5x}{x+5}=\dfrac{5}{2}$. Solve: $10x = 5x + 25$ ‚áí $5x=25$ ‚áí $x=5$. Milk $=5x=25$ L.
**Answer: A) 25 L.**

---

### Q13 ‚Äî HCF = 12, product = 1728. Find LCM.

Property: HCF √ó LCM = product of numbers. So LCM $=1728/12 = 144.$
**Answer: A) 144.**

---

### Q14 ‚Äî If SP is doubled, profit triples. Find original profit percentage.

Let CP = $C$, original SP = $S$. Original profit $= S-C$. New SP $=2S$. New profit $=2S-C$. Given new profit = 3 √ó original profit:
$2S - C = 3(S - C)$. Expand: $2S - C = 3S - 3C$ ‚áí bring terms together ‚áí $2C = S$. So original selling price $S = 2C$.
Original profit $= S - C = C$. Profit% $= \dfrac{C}{C}\times100\% = 100\%$.

**Important:** The correct answer is **100%**, which is **not** among the printed options (50%, 60%, 66.67%, 75%). The printed options appear incorrect for this question.

---

### Q15 ‚Äî Garbled in PDF. Standard intended equation (common type) is $2^{x+1} = 8^{\,x-1}$.

I'll solve that customary form (if the PDF had a different equation, tell me and I‚Äôll re-solve).

Assume: $2^{x+1} = 8^{x-1}$. Since $8=2^3$:
$2^{x+1} = 2^{3(x-1)} = 2^{3x-3}$. So exponents equal: $x+1 = 3x-3$ ‚áí $2x=4$ ‚áí $x=2$.
**Answer (under that interpretation): C) 2.**

*(If you want, upload a screenshot of the exact line in the PDF and I‚Äôll confirm the intended formula.)*

### Q16 ‚Äî Sum of three consecutive odd numbers = 123. Largest?

Let numbers be $n, n+2, n+4$. Sum $= 3n+6 = 123$. So $3n = 117$ ‚áí $n=39$. Largest $= n+4 = 43$.
**Answer: C) 43.**

---

### Q17 ‚Äî In class 60% are boys. If girls = 18, how many boys?

Girls are 40% ‚áí total students $= 18/0.4 = 45$. Boys $= 45 - 18 = 27$.
**Answer: B) 27.**

# üîé Reasoning / Logic & Arrangement

### Q18 ‚Äî Syllogism:

Premises:

1. All engineers are logical. (Engineers ‚äÇ Logical)
2. Some logical people are good communicators. (Some Logical ‚à© Communicators ‚â† ‚àÖ)
3. No good communicator is careless. (Communicators ‚äÇ Not-Careless)

Conclusions:
I. Some engineers are good communicators. ‚Äî **Not necessarily**: All engineers are in the logical group, but the fact that *some* logical people are communicators does not guarantee that any engineer is among those *some*. So I does **not** follow logically.
II. Some logical people are not careless. ‚Äî **Yes**: The ‚Äúsome logical people‚Äù who are good communicators are (by premise 3) not careless. So there exist logical people who are not careless ‚áí II follows.
**Answer: B) Only II follows.**

### Q19 ‚Äî Seating (five students A,B,C,D,E facing north). Conditions:

* A is left of B but not at an end.
* C sits at the extreme left.
* D sits to the right of B.
  Question: Who sits between A and D?

**Interpretation note (standard convention in many such puzzles):** ‚Äúleft of / to the right of‚Äù typically means immediate left/right *unless* stated otherwise. Using that convention yields a unique arrangement; if you interpret ‚Äúleft of‚Äù as merely somewhere to left (not necessarily immediate), the problem can become ambiguous. I‚Äôll adopt the conventional immediate-neighbour reading so the problem has a unique answer.

Positions left‚Üíright (1..5), with 1 = extreme left:

* C at pos1.
* A is immediately left of B and A is not at an end ‚áí A must be pos2, B pos3.
* D is immediately right of B ‚áí D pos4.
  So arrangement: **C ‚Äì A ‚Äì B ‚Äì D ‚Äì E**. Between A (pos2) and D (pos4) sits **B** (pos3).
  **Answer: A) B.**

(If you want the non-immediate interpretation worked out too I can list all possible valid arrangements and show whether the answer is unique.)

### Q20 ‚Äî ODD ONE OUT: 121, 169, 225, 289, 361. Which doesn‚Äôt belong?

Write bases: $121=11^2,\;169=13^2,\;225=15^2,\;289=17^2,\;361=19^2$. These are squares of consecutive odd integers 11,13,15,17,19. One distinguishing property: **225 (15¬≤)** is the only one whose base (15) is **composite**; the others are squares of **prime** bases (11,13,17,19). Also 225 is the only one divisible by 3. Either property singles 225 out.
**Answer: C) 225.**
