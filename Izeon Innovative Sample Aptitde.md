# üß† Work, Time & Speed

### Q1 ‚Äî train speed ‚Üë 20% so time reduces by 10 min. Find original time.

Let original time = $T$. If speed increases by 20%, new speed = $1.2\times$ original ‚áí time becomes $\dfrac{T}{1.2}=\dfrac{5}{6}T$.
Difference: $T - \dfrac{5}{6}T = \dfrac{T}{6} = 10$ minutes ‚áí $T = 60$ minutes.
**Answer: B) 60 min.**

---

### Q2 ‚Äî pipes: fill in 10 h, 12 h; drain in 20 h. All open together ‚Üí time to fill?

Rates (tank per hour): Pipe1 = $1/10$, Pipe2 = $1/12$, Drain = $-1/20$.
Net rate = $1/10 + 1/12 - 1/20$. Use LCM 60: $(6 + 5 - 3)/60 = 8/60 = 2/15$ tank/hour.
Time = reciprocal = $15/2 = 7.5$ hours = **7 h 30 min**.
**Note:** 7.5 h is the correct exact answer; the printed options (7, 8, 6, 9) do **not** include 7.5.
**Correct result:** 7.5 hours (7 hr 30 min).

---

### Q10 ‚Äî A = 8 days, B = 12 days. Together?

Rates: $1/8 + 1/12 = (3+2)/24 = 5/24$ job/day. Time $= 24/5 = 4.8$ days.
**Answer: A) 4.8 days.**

---

### Q11 ‚Äî train 60 km/h crosses pole in 9 s. Find length.

Convert speed to m/s: $60 \times \dfrac{1000}{3600} = \dfrac{50}{3}$ m/s.
Length $= \text{speed} \times \text{time} = \dfrac{50}{3}\times 9 = 150$ m.
**Answer: B) 150 m.**

---

### Q12 ‚Äî 10 men ‚áí 15 days. How many days for 6 men?

Total work = $10\times 15 =150$ man-days. With 6 men: $150/6 = 25$ days.
**Answer: B) 25 days.**

---

# üî¢ Numbers & Arithmetic

### Q3 ‚Äî two-digit number: digits sum 10; reversing decreases number by 36. Find original.

Let digits be $a$ (tens) and $b$ (units). $a+b=10$. Original = $10a+b$. Reversed = $10b+a$.
Difference: $(10a+b)-(10b+a)=9(a-b)=36$ ‚áí $a-b=4$. Solve with $a+b=10$: $2a=14$ ‚áí $a=7, b=3$. Number = **73**.
**Answer: A) 73.**

---

### Q4 ‚Äî lift 50 kg to 10 m in 25 s. Power required? (g = 9.8 m/s¬≤)

Work = $mgh = 50\times 9.8 \times 10 = 4900$ J. Power = Work / time = $4900/25 = 196$ W.
**Answer: A) 196 W.**

---

### Q5 ‚Äî avg of 20 students = 21; with teacher (21 people) avg = 22. Teacher‚Äôs age?

Sum of students = $20\times21 = 420$. Total with teacher = $21\times22 = 462$. Teacher‚Äôs age = $462-420 = 42$.
**Answer: B) 42 years.**

---

### Q6 ‚Äî ODD ONE OUT: 169, 196, 225, 256, 289. Which doesn‚Äôt belong?

Check representations:

* 169 = $13^2$
* 196 = $14^2$
* 225 = $15^2$
* 256 = $16^2$ and also $4^4 = 2^8$ (a perfect 4th power / pure power of 2)
* 289 = $17^2$

**Observation:** 256 is the only number that is also a perfect 4th power (and a pure power of 2). The others are simple squares of consecutive integers but *not* higher perfect powers. So 256 stands out.
**Answer: D) 256.**

(Other valid distinguishing properties exist, but the 4th-power/ power-of-2 distinction is the cleanest.)

---

### Q7 ‚Äî circular field circumference = 88 m. Area?

Circumference $=2\pi r = 88$. Using $\pi = 22/7$ we get $r = 88/(2\pi)=88/(44/7)=14$ m.
Area $=\pi r^2 = \dfrac{22}{7}\times 14^2 = \dfrac{22}{7}\times196 = 616$ m¬≤.
**Answer: A) 616 m¬≤.**

---

### Q8 ‚Äî CP of 15 articles = SP of 12 articles. Profit %?

Let CP per article = $c$, SP per article = $s$. Given $15c = 12s \Rightarrow s = \dfrac{15}{12}c = \dfrac{5}{4}c$.
Profit per article = $s-c = \dfrac{1}{4}c$. Profit% $= \dfrac{1/4c}{c}\times100 = 25\%$.
**Answer: B) 25%.**

---

### Q9 ‚Äî milk\:water = 5:1. After adding 5 L water ratio becomes 5:2. Original milk quantity?

Let milk = $5x$, water = $x$. After adding 5 L water: $5x:(x+5) = 5:2$. So $\dfrac{5x}{x+5}=\dfrac{5}{2}$. Solve: $10x = 5x + 25$ ‚áí $5x=25$ ‚áí $x=5$. Milk $=5x=25$ L.
**Answer: A) 25 L.**

---

### Q13 ‚Äî HCF = 12, product = 1728. Find LCM.

Property: HCF √ó LCM = product of numbers. So LCM $=1728/12 = 144.$
**Answer: A) 144.**

---

### Q14 ‚Äî If SP is doubled, profit triples. Find original profit percentage.

Let CP = $C$, original SP = $S$. Original profit $= S-C$. New SP $=2S$. New profit $=2S-C$. Given new profit = 3 √ó original profit:
$2S - C = 3(S - C)$. Expand: $2S - C = 3S - 3C$ ‚áí bring terms together ‚áí $2C = S$. So original selling price $S = 2C$.
Original profit $= S - C = C$. Profit% $= \dfrac{C}{C}\times100\% = 100\%$.

**Important:** The correct answer is **100%**, which is **not** among the printed options (50%, 60%, 66.67%, 75%). The printed options appear incorrect for this question.

### Q15 ‚Äî Garbled in PDF. Standard intended equation (common type) is $2^{x+1} = 8^{\,x-1}$.

I'll solve that customary form (if the PDF had a different equation, tell me and I‚Äôll re-solve).

Assume: $2^{x+1} = 8^{x-1}$. Since $8=2^3$:
$2^{x+1} = 2^{3(x-1)} = 2^{3x-3}$. So exponents equal: $x+1 = 3x-3$ ‚áí $2x=4$ ‚áí $x=2$.
**Answer (under that interpretation): C) 2.**

*(If you want, upload a screenshot of the exact line in the PDF and I‚Äôll confirm the intended formula.)*

---

### Q16 ‚Äî Sum of three consecutive odd numbers = 123. Largest?

Let numbers be $n, n+2, n+4$. Sum $= 3n+6 = 123$. So $3n = 117$ ‚áí $n=39$. Largest $= n+4 = 43$.
**Answer: C) 43.**

---

### Q17 ‚Äî In class 60% are boys. If girls = 18, how many boys?

Girls are 40% ‚áí total students $= 18/0.4 = 45$. Boys $= 45 - 18 = 27$.
**Answer: B) 27.**

# üîé Reasoning / Logic & Arrangement

### Q18 ‚Äî Syllogism:

Premises:

1. All engineers are logical. (Engineers ‚äÇ Logical)
2. Some logical people are good communicators. (Some Logical ‚à© Communicators ‚â† ‚àÖ)
3. No good communicator is careless. (Communicators ‚äÇ Not-Careless)

Conclusions:
I. Some engineers are good communicators. ‚Äî **Not necessarily**: All engineers are in the logical group, but the fact that *some* logical people are communicators does not guarantee that any engineer is among those *some*. So I does **not** follow logically.
II. Some logical people are not careless. ‚Äî **Yes**: The ‚Äúsome logical people‚Äù who are good communicators are (by premise 3) not careless. So there exist logical people who are not careless ‚áí II follows.
**Answer: B) Only II follows.**

### Q19 ‚Äî Seating (five students A,B,C,D,E facing north). Conditions:

* A is left of B but not at an end.
* C sits at the extreme left.
* D sits to the right of B.
  Question: Who sits between A and D?

**Interpretation note (standard convention in many such puzzles):** ‚Äúleft of / to the right of‚Äù typically means immediate left/right *unless* stated otherwise. Using that convention yields a unique arrangement; if you interpret ‚Äúleft of‚Äù as merely somewhere to left (not necessarily immediate), the problem can become ambiguous. I‚Äôll adopt the conventional immediate-neighbour reading so the problem has a unique answer.

Positions left‚Üíright (1..5), with 1 = extreme left:

* C at pos1.
* A is immediately left of B and A is not at an end ‚áí A must be pos2, B pos3.
* D is immediately right of B ‚áí D pos4.
  So arrangement: **C ‚Äì A ‚Äì B ‚Äì D ‚Äì E**. Between A (pos2) and D (pos4) sits **B** (pos3).
  **Answer: A) B.**

(If you want the non-immediate interpretation worked out too I can list all possible valid arrangements and show whether the answer is unique.)

### Q20 ‚Äî ODD ONE OUT: 121, 169, 225, 289, 361. Which doesn‚Äôt belong?

Write bases: $121=11^2,\;169=13^2,\;225=15^2,\;289=17^2,\;361=19^2$. These are squares of consecutive odd integers 11,13,15,17,19. One distinguishing property: **225 (15¬≤)** is the only one whose base (15) is **composite**; the others are squares of **prime** bases (11,13,17,19). Also 225 is the only one divisible by 3. Either property singles 225 out.
**Answer: C) 225.**
